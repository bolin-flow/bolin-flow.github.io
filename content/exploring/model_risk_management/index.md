The Federal Reserve and OCC's guidance on model risk management outlines standards that banks need to follow to ensure the reliability and integrity of their financial models. Effective model risk management is crucial for maintaining the bank's financial stability and reputation. 

Reviewing the Federal Reserve's Supervisory Letter SR 11-7 "Guidance on Model Risk Management," can provide more details in the key aspects of an effective model risk management framework, including robust model development, implementation, and use; effective validation; and sound governance, policies, and controls.

The use of models invariably presents model risk, which is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making, or damage to a banking organization’s reputation.

Model risk occurs primarily for two reasons:  
- (1) a model may have fundamental errors and produce inaccurate outputs when viewed against its design objective and intended business uses; 
- (2) a model may be used incorrectly or inappropriately or there may be a misunderstanding about its limitations and assumptions. 
  
Fundamental Errors: A model might have basic flaws, causing it to produce inaccurate results for its intended purpose.
Misuse: A model might be used inappropriately, or people might misunderstand its assumptions and limitations.

Model risk increases with greater model complexity, higher uncertainty about inputs and assumptions, broader extent of use, and larger potential impact. We need effective challenge as a principle for managing model risk, requiring that models undergo critical analysis by people who are objective, knowledgeable, and capable of understanding the model's limitations. 

## Model Validation
Model validation is the set of processes and activities intended to verify that models are performing as expected, in line with their design objectives and business uses. Effective validation helps to ensure that models are sound, identifying potential limitations and assumptions and assessing their possible impact. All model components—inputs, processing, outputs, and reports—should be subject to validation; this applies equally to models developed in-house and to those purchased from or developed by vendors or consultants.

Validation involves a degree of independence from model development and use. Generally, validation is done by staff who are not responsible for model development or use and do not have a stake in whether a model is determined to be valid. As a practical matter, some validation work may be most effectively done by model developers and users; it is essential, however, that such validation work be subject to critical review by an independent party, who should conduct additional activities to ensure proper validation. Overall, the quality of the validation process is indicated by critical review by objective, knowledgeable parties and the actions taken to address issues identified by those parties.
