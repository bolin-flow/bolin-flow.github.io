## Strategies for the AI Era

AI embodies distinct capabilities rather than functionalities. Developing the right AI capabilities and assembling complementary teams are essential.
A key question is how to design a system centered on AI memory and retrieval contexts, tailored to the needs of diverse users. Training LLMs will persist, even when encountering a scaling wall where enhancing intelligence becomes increasingly challenging at high-inteligent levels. Smarter training with high-quality data can further unlock improvements and ultimately reach the critical tipping point, significantly transforming everyday life.

For AI enterprises, building own foundation model marks a critical milestone. These large-scale models serve as the operating systems and programming languages of the AI era, powering superproducts akin to current semiconductors and acting as gateways to next-generation devices.

For AI start-ups, the focus should be on envisioning the products that will shape and integrate into people’s lives over the next 3-5 years, then working backward to identify the technologies needed to realize these innovations.

The potential of the robotic AI industry is constrained by challenges in both AI algorithms and robotics. Robotics has not yet reached a technological tipping point, with most efforts centered on open-source and collaborative innovation. Developing robotic hardware requires significant hands-on experience and a longer learning curve, though the industry is relatively standardized for new learners. In contrast, AI algorithm development relies on a small pool of leading research labs, with algorithmic limitations now presenting greater challenges than hardware. To create AI robots that genuinely enhance daily life, we need not only [semantic intelligence but also physical intelligence](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yM4m1D7tC/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=2ebd024eac0b9cf1de30b74eb35caaf8) to perform real-world tasks (e.g., understanding principles like Newton’s laws and achieving precise control).

Recognize that consumer acceptance of electronic products is a gradual process. It's important to evaluate a product from a higher perspective see whether one product has the potential to become a common category in society in the future.  When innovating in consumer electronics, start by thoroughly understanding the current market landscape. Identify popular products and pinpoint unmet or unsatisfied needs that could be addressed to provide additional value. Building upon the success of existing products can be a strategic and reliable approach to attracting new customers. 

## Models & Algorithms Development

When developing AI algorithms and predictive models, it is important to first assess whether the task at hand is best addressed using rules-based systems, traditional machine learning, or generative AI algorithms. In factory or enterprise settings, cost-effective, as these environments typically feature well-defined scenarios. For consumer-facing applications, the situation is more complex. It involves diverse contexts, ethical considerations, and "last-mile" challenges, which require additional time and effort to resolve.

Avoid blindly following scaling laws. In the field of LLMs or NLP, researchers have demonstrated the effects of scaling laws on next-token generation tasks through experiments with GPT2 and GPT3 models. However, in other domains, it is more prudent to first validate methods with smaller datasets and models rather than focusing solely on scaling up data and model size.

What will the next groundbreaking architecture be? It’s hard to predict. It often takes 4-5 years for practitioners and researchers to identify a truly transformative foundational architecture. For example, diffusion models introduced in 2015 and transformers proposed in 2017 have only been recognized as revolutionary advancements in the last few years.  The Transformer architecture demonstrated its effectiveness in processing large datasets using GPUs. One advanced architecture should excel at identifying the most relevant information within large datasets.

## Strategies for Personal Growth

First, we need to acknowledge that the world wasn’t designed solely for enjoyment; difficult times are an inevitable part of life. The key question lies in how we face challenges and the mindset we adopt in doing so. Next, we prepare ourselves and condition our minds. Most importantly, instead of running away, we face difficulties head-on, even when they bring discomfort. Embrace difficulties as challenges, and redefine every challenge as one training for growing and expanding. By approaching challenges as training opportunities, we also need to recognize that no one is born a superhero or naturally equipped with strength and confidence. These qualities develop gradually through consistent effort, training, and repetition. Repetition creates mastery. 

Acknowledge that most aspects of life are beyond our control, much like climbing an unknown mountain. Searching for the "perfect path" to the top is often unrealistic. Instead, progress is made step by step: take a step, face challenges, make adjustments, receive feedback, and keep moving forward. It’s essential to maintain a "firm yet flexible goal", approaching each step with thoughtful intention. At the same time, we should not let the perceived negatives distract or deter us from our overarching objective.

Fully accepting our own traits is essential, and understand these traits can have both positive and negative effects. The key is to build based on our traits and [collaborate with others who complement us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbiPeZnmz9A&t=7940s), forming a stronger team.

[Be proactive in making our own choices.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) Approach decisions with a positive and proactive mindset, recognizing that we always have the ability to choose. The opposite of "making choices" is "judging right or wrong", it fixates on labeling A or B rather than exploring possibilities. Choosing focuses on evaluating options to determine the better, driven by openness and a growth-oriented perspective. Most importantly, remember that choices are rarely constrained to two options.
