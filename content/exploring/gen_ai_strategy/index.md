## Strategies for the AI Era

AI embodies distinct capabilities rather than functionalities. Developing the right AI capabilities and assembling complementary teams are essential.
A key question is how to design a system centered on AI memory, tailored to the needs of diverse users.

For AI enterprises, building own foundation model marks a critical milestone. These large-scale models serve as the operating systems and programming languages of the AI era, powering superproducts akin to current semiconductors and acting as gateways to next-generation devices.

For AI start-ups, the focus should be on envisioning the products that will shape and integrate into people’s lives over the next 3-5 years, then working backward to identify the technologies needed to realize these innovations.

The potential of the robotic AI industry is constrained by challenges in both AI algorithms and robotics. Robotics has not yet reached a technological tipping point, with most efforts centered on open-source and collaborative innovation. Developing robotic hardware requires significant hands-on experience and a longer learning curve, though the industry is relatively standardized for new learners. In contrast, AI algorithm development relies on a small pool of leading research labs, with algorithmic limitations now presenting greater challenges than hardware. To create AI robots that genuinely enhance daily life, we need not only semantic intelligence but also physical intelligence to perform real-world tasks (e.g., understanding principles like Newton’s laws and achieving precise control).



## Strategies for Personal Growth

First, we need to acknowledge that the world wasn’t designed solely for enjoyment; difficult times are an inevitable part of life. The key question lies in how we face challenges and the mindset we adopt in doing so.

Next, we prepare ourselves and condition our minds. Most importantly, instead of running away, we face difficulties head-on, even when they bring discomfort. Embrace difficulties as challenges, and redefine every challenge as one training for growing and expanding.

By approaching challenges as training opportunities, we also need to recognize that no one is born a superhero or naturally equipped with strength and confidence. These qualities develop gradually through consistent effort, training, and repetition. Repetition creates mastery. 

Acknowledge that most aspects of life are beyond our control, much like climbing an unknown mountain. Searching for the "perfect path" to the top is often unrealistic. Instead, progress is made step by step: take a step, face challenges, make adjustments, receive feedback, and keep moving forward. It’s essential to maintain a "firm yet flexible goal", approaching each step with thoughtful intention. At the same time, we should not let the perceived negatives distract or deter us from our overarching objective.
