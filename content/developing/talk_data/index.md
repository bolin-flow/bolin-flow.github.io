 I've always wondered how to interact with documents in a way that deepens my understanding. I wish I could read books in a playful, back-and-forth manner to spark new insights and contemplate deeper. Now, with LLMs, we can achieve this easily. In this post, I want to use free open-source package to build a chatbot that acts like a patient teacher, always ready to provide answers within the knowledge domain we define.

Iâ€™ll be using `Llamaindex` to implement most of the functionalities. With packages and frameworks constantly evolving, the bigger questions are how to easily build or apply this streamlined solution and how products like this can further enhance our everyday lives.
