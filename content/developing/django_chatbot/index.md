Download `Django` and use it to build a web application with chat functionality. Start by creating a folder named `my_project` by running the command `django-admin startproject my_project`. Once we run this command, Django will generate a new folder named my_project, setting up the essential files and structure needed to begin development.

In a Django project, we can have multiple apps, each with a specific purpose. These apps should be related to each other in a way that supports the overall functionality of the project. Type `python manage.py startapp blog` to build one app called blog. 

A folder named blog is created, containing files like admin.py, apps.py, models.py, views.py, and more. 
- admin.py: Manages the integration with Djangoâ€™s admin interface, allowing for authentication and administrative functions.
- models.py: A crucial file that defines data models for the app, such as users, comments, and other entities that need to be stored in the database.
- views.py: Contains functions that control what users see by rendering templates and handling logic for different pages.
- Migrations: These files handle database changes, allowing us to create and modify database structures as the models evolve.

To run the Django project, execute `python manage.py runserver` in the terminal:
