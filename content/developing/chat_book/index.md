 I've always been curious about interacting with books and documents in a way that deepens my understanding. I want to read in a dynamic, interactive way that sparks new insights and encourages deeper contemplation. I wish there were more visuals, thought-provoking questions, and summarized topics or keywords for each section to help readers comprehend and distill what they read. I also want to control over how the content is organized and navigated, allowing me to make notes or understand it more easilyâ€”especially when reading something in my second language.

There are numerous tools available to build these functionalities. For instance, we can parse and split large documents, generate interactive responses using LLMs and embedding models, and utilize various information retrieval techniques. For each text chunk, we can also extract keywords using pretrained BERT models or apply clustering to derive relevant topics from the data. While these tools and methods exist, one challenge lies in cohesively integrating these functionalities to create a smooth user experience with the application. Moreover, when policy constraints are involved, we must ensure secure hosting and proper evaluation of models and datasets, especially for unsupervised learning algorithms, generative models, and datasets containing PII. In this article, I focus on exploring Azure search services, as they provide hosting, monitoring, and evaluation capabilities within Azure cloud platform, streamlining the security compliance process under a single provider.
